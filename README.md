# ai-fashion-automation

The fashion e-commerce industry relies heavily on manual processes for product catalog management, trend analysis, and customer engagement. Tasks such as image tagging, product description writing, and trend forecasting are time-consuming, inconsistent, and not scalable. This thesis proposes an AI-powered automated system that leverages computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning to streamline these processes while delivering personalized user experiences.


Objectives
By the end of this thesis, the system will:

1- Automatically generate product tags from fashion images.

2- Generate natural-language product descriptions.

3- Identify and predict fashion trends using data-driven analysis.

4- Provide a chatbot-based personalized styling and product discovery experience.

5- Demonstrate efficiency improvements over manual catalog management.
